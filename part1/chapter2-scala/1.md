# 2.1 Scala basics

## Classes

Classes in Scala are blueprints for creating objects. They can contain methods, values, variables, types, objects, traits, and classes which are collectively called _members_. Types, objects, and traits will be covered later in this Chapter.

### Defining a class

Class `Point` has 4 members: variables `x` and `y`, methods `move` and `toString`. Its constructor is in the class signature `(var x: Int, var y: Int)`. 

The move method takes 2 integer arguments and returns the Unit value `()`, which carries no information. This corresponds roughly with `void` in Java-like languages.

`toString`, on the other hand, does not take any arguments but returns a `String` value. Since `toString` overrides `toString` from [`AnyRef`](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/unified-types.html), it is tagged with the `override` keyword.

```scala
class Point(var x: Int, var y: Int) {
    def move(dx: Int, dy: Int): Unit = {
        x = x + dx
        y = y + dy
    }
    override def toString: String =
        s"($x, $y)"
}

val point1 = new Point(2,3)
point1.x //2
println(point) // prints (2,3)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Similar to Java, Scala uses the keyword `new` to instantiate a class. However, instantiation shouldn't be written in the same file with the declaration of the class, in this case, _Point.scala._ So last 3 lines should be written in other file, say like, the _Main.scala_ file. 
{% endhint %}

### Constructors

Constructors can have optical parameters by providing default values: 

```scala
class Point(var x: Int = 0, var y: Int = 0)

val origin = new Point  // x and y are both set to 0

val point1 = new Point(1) // set x to be 1
println(point1.x)  // prints 1

val point2 = new Point(y=2) // to simply set y, you'll need to name the parameter
println(point2.y)  // prints 2
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Constructor reads arguments left to right, to simply set `y` \(the 2nd parameter\), you'll need to name the parameter. Doing so also enhances clarity of the code.
{% endhint %}

### Private Members, Getter and Setter

Members are public by default.  Use the `private` access modifier to hide them from outside of the class.

```scala
class Point {
  private var _x = 0
  private var _y = 0
  private val bound = 100

  def x = _x  //Getter
  def x_= (newValue: Int): Unit = {  //Setter
    if (newValue < bound) {
      _x = newValue
      println("x value set to " + newValue)
    }
    else printWarning
  }

  def y= _y  //Getter
  def y_= (newValue: Int): Unit = {  //Setter
    if (newValue < bound) {
      _y = newValue
      println("y value set to " + newValue)
    }  else printWarning
  }

  private def printWarning= println("WARNING: Out of bounds")
}

val point1 = new Point
point1.x = 99 // prints "x value set to 99"
point1.y = 101 // prints the warning
```

Data is stored in the private variables `_x` and `_y` . Using methods `def x` and `def y` to access the private data, which is the Getter. Methods `def x_=` and `def y_=` are for validating and setting the value of `_x` and `_y`, which is the Setter. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Be careful of the syntax!!!**

* Variables name \(attributes name\): `_abc`
* Getter method name: `def abc`
* Setter method name: `def abc_=`

**How to call a Getter/Setter function:**

```scala
val example = new Example
//setter
example.abc_=(10)
//getter
println(example.abc)
```
