# 2.1 Scala basics

## Classes

Classes in Scala are blueprints for creating objects. They can contain methods, values, variables, types, objects, traits, and classes which are collectively called _members_. Types, objects, and traits will be covered later in this Chapter.

### Defining a class

Class `Point` has 4 members: variables `x` and `y`, methods `move` and `toString`. Its constructor is in the class signature `(var x: Int, var y: Int)`. 

The move method takes 2 integer arguments and returns the Unit value `()`, which carries no information. This corresponds roughly with `void` in Java-like languages.

`toString`, on the other hand, does not take any arguments but returns a `String` value. Since `toString` overrides `toString` from [`AnyRef`](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/unified-types.html), it is tagged with the `override` keyword.

```scala
class Point(var x: Int, var y: Int) {
    def move(dx: Int, dy: Int): Unit = {
        x = x + dx
        y = y + dy
    }
    override def toString: String =
        s"($x, $y)"
}

val point1 = new Point(2,3)
point1.x //2
println(point) // prints (2,3)
```

 Similar to Java, scala uses the keyword `new` to instantiate a class.
